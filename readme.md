# GPT Template for Node.js
These are the basic bones of a web chat interface with streaming, saving messages to firebase, and pulling back the last five messages so that it has a bit of memory. I wrote this to make it easier to spin up applications with GPT as the base. You don't have to use firebase or save the conversations, you could use Assistants with GPT and it would do that for you. However I wanted to make it easy enough to swap in alternatives like Claude, which don't follow the assistant flows. Also, Once you get into assistants you need to manage state of threading (at least at the time I tried it) and that came with a fair amount of infrastructure. I might add it here along with some toggles between models, but for now I just wanted to get people started. I'm using node.js because it is easier for people who can't code to have Claude or GPT do your coding for you (without tab issues slowing you down) and because the socket communication between front and back just seem to work easier. All of this was run in Replit, which I recommend for non-coders to use.
